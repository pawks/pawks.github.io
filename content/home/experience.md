        * Design and implement micro-architectural improvements for a 6stage in-order RISC-V Cores.
        * Design Multi-core RISC-V processor with hierarchial and coherent Caches.
        * Conceptualised and directed implementation of various features for key tools in the RISC‐V Architectural Testing ecosystem for testing various extensions in the specification.

        * Designed and implemented a secure boot solution for Shakti RISC‐V cores. The solution consisted of a signing tool, framework and run‐time libraries to be integrated with the firmware.
        * Designed extensions to support higher level API calls and provide better security guarantees.
        * Proposed a scheme to support trusted execution environments using a co‐processor by analysing various solutions such as Intel SGX, Sanctum and Keystone.

        * Evaluated various methods to generate bluespec code for SOCs based on a given configuration. Implemented a tool which could automatically generate SOCs with optimal address mappings for heterogeneous and hierarchical busses.
        * Identified key csr configuration options in the RISC‐V ISA and designed a scheme to describe the custom behaviours. Implemented an open‐source tool([riscv-config](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-config)) in python to validate descriptions and verify legality of behaviours.
        * Evaluated various strategies for RISC‐V architectural compliance testing and implemented a dynamic, scalable and easy‐to‐use open‐source framework([riscof](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscof)) based on the best strategy.
