 abstract = {Considering the modularity of RISC-V, proving the compatibility
of implementations against the ISA has become critical to prevent
fragmentation and ensure its success. The test suite needed to
achieve this should cater to all legal enumerations of the ISA and
determine with high confidence, the ISA compatibility of the target.
This paper proposes open-source tools(RISCV-ISAC and RISCV-
CTG) which significantly automate building and maintenance of a
high quality and scalable test suite. RISCV-ISAC collects coverage
from execution logs and checks for data propagation to signature.
RISCV-CTG is a coverage driven test generator, which generates
minimal tests for maximum coverage with RISCV-ISAC.},
