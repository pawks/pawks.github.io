abstract: Considering the modularity of RISC-V, proving the compatibility of implementations
  against the ISA has become critical to prevent fragmentation and ensure its success.
  The test suite needed to achieve this should cater to all legal enumerations of
  the ISA and determine with high confidence, the ISA compatibility of the target.
  This paper proposes open-source tools(RISCV-ISAC and RISCV- CTG) which significantly
  automate building and maintenance of a high quality and scalable test suite. RISCV-ISAC
  collects coverage from execution logs and checks for data propagation to signature.
  RISCV-CTG is a coverage driven test generator, which generates minimal tests for
  maximum coverage with RISCV-ISAC.
