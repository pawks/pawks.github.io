title: "RISCV-ISAC: RISC-V ISA Coverage Generator"
summary: Defines an open source coverage specification format using only the fields in the ISA.
    Thereby, providing a free, independent and scalable coverage measurement tool for Architectural
    Compatibility Testing. It also analyses the instruction trace to provide data propagation
    reports which are critical for memory signature based tests. The data propagation reports ensure
    that bugs in the implementation manifest as mismatched signature when compared with the golden
    model.
